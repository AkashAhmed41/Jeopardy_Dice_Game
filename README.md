# Jeopardy_Dice_Game
A simple Pig Game in which two players race to reach 100 points and who reaches first, wins the game. **"Player-1"** rolls the dice first by default .
## About the game
Each player has his turn to roll the dice until he rolls a 1. If a player rolls a 1, then he gains nothing and it's the opponents' turn. A player can hold his total point in a turn which actually adds that score to his *Total score* in the game. Holding points also provides the opponent to roll the dice. The players play like this till someone wins. Besides, The game can be renewed at any point of time by clicking ***"New Game"*** button which restores everything to the initial state.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML and CSS have been used to build the game. The idea of ***DOM Manipulation*** in JavaScript is the foundation of this project.
